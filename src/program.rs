//! Parsing and handling program syntax(es) of the shell.
//!
//! Both, commands entered to the shell interactively through STDIN, and read
//! from a file, are *programs*. Our shell provides multiple discrete languages
//! to write programs in, each with a corresponding implementation of this
//! module's `Program` trait.
//!
//! ### POSIX Shell Language
//!
//! The basic, portable POSIX shell language. For detailed information read the
//! [`posix`](program::posix) module docs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! for ((i=0; i<10; i++)); do echo $i; done
//! ```
//!
//! ### Modern Shell Language
//!
//! A more modern and ergonomic language. For more detailed information read
//! the [`modern`](program::modern) module docs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! # WIP
//! for i in (0..10) { echo $i }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Default Syntax
//!
//! Our shell has a `PrimaryProgram` which is in charge of parsing programs
//! which are not passed in via a `{#}` language block. This can be configured
//! to your preference. This does not effect the shell when launched in
//! POSIX compatibility mode, or when a specific default language is passed
//! as a flag.
//!
//! ### `{#}` Language Blocks
//!
//! Both the [`posix`](program::posix) and [`modern`](program::modern)
//! languages have support for a special expression which treats the body as a
//! program from another language. This forms the basis of oursh's modern
//! features, and backwards compatibility. While the primary goal of this
//! syntax is to be able to mix both POSIX and non-POSIX shell scripts, the
//! feature is much more powerful.  Any interperator can be used, just like
//! with `#!`.
//!
//! ```sh
//! date      # Call `date` in the primary syntax.
//! {# date}  # Specifies the alternate syntax.
//!
//! # Use ruby, why not...
//! {#!ruby
//!     require 'date'
//!     puts Date.today
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Strict POSIX compatibility can be enabled by removing this feature alone.
//!
//! - TODO #5: Parse sequence of programs from stream.
//! - TODO #5: Partial parses for readline-ish / syntax highlighting.
