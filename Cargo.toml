# TODO: Justify and explain features.

# Enables lexing of TEXT tokens, and parsing of `SheBang`, `HashLang`,
# `AltLang` blocks. Without this feature, the POSIX shell aims not to vary
# from a proper POSIX implementation at all.

# Raw terminal mode for better control of the IO interactions. This allows
# things like arrow keys for history, and cursor editing.

# Save the history of commands (entered) for quick recall.
# TODO: Stop depending on raw if this ever interacts with anything beside the
# RELP input.
